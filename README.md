## 🔐 Submission Guidelines

To ensure fairness, **do not make your solution public**.

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Create a private repository** under your GitHub account.
3. Push your changes to a **feature branch** in that private repository.
4. Add **`@cheloveq` as a collaborator** so we can review your solution.

## 🧰 Stack & Tooling

This project is already set up with:

- **TanStack Router**
- **TanStack Query**
- **ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS**

You'll find examples of pages, components, and application structure already in place.

### 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the development server
- `npm run check` — run type checking, linting, and formatting checks

## 📋 Your Task

Implement a **User List Page** that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a list of cards.

### Requirements

1. **Fetch users** from the following API:

   > <https://dummyjson.com/users>  
   > API docs: <https://dummyjson.com/docs/users>

2. Display each user as a **card**, containing:

   - Profile image
   - Full name
   - Username
   - Email
   - Gender

3. The list must support:
   - **Pagination** (preferably infinite scroll)
   - **Search/filtering** by a user-provided input (e.g., search bar)

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

We are looking for production-quality work. You will be evaluated on:

- **Code quality** (structure, cleanliness, readability)
- **Commit history** (conventional commits, small, meaningful commits preferred)
- **UX & functionality** (does it feel polished and intuitive?)
- **Performance** (basic optimization, clean API usage, etc.)
- **Maintainability & extensibility** (how easy it is to build upon your work)

---

## 🕑 Timebox

- You should spend **no more than 3 hours** on the task.
- If you go over the limit, that’s okay — just **let us know**.

---

## 🤖 AI & Tools

- **Use of LLMs (like ChatGPT or Copilot) is allowed**.
- Any additional libraries/tools are also welcome if they improve your workflow or the result.

---

## 🎨 Design & UX

There are **no strict UI/UX constraints** — we trust your judgment as a developer. Just aim for clarity, usability, and consistency.

Good luck — we look forward to reviewing your solution! 💪
